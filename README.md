# Carbon-garden
My team and I's submission to the Tech Together Boston 2020 hackathon:
We created carbon garden to help individuals learn about their carbon footprints and provide resources for them to explore how to reduce their carbon footprints. In order to make our site fun and interactive instead of purely informative, we created a garden page that reflects the user's carbon footprint after taking the quiz. As we were very limited on time during the hackathon, we were not able to acheive full functionality, but that is something we hope to work on in the future. Our current site is available to view at https://TTB.sanyaguptaa.repl.co
